# Game Quest

## Overview

The Game Quest is a web application designed to help users develop good habits and reduce bad habits through a gamified approach. Users set productive goals and tasks, earn virtual coins for achieving them, and use these coins to buy tasks in a virtual market. Tasks in the market are typically unproductive or negative habits. The system encourages users to replace bad habits with productive ones by leveraging a reward system.
